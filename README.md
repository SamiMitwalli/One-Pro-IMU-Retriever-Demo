# XREAL One Pro IMU Retriever Script
This Python script is a proof of concept that retrieves a stream of data from the XREAL One Pro's IMU via TCP, parsing the gyroscope and accelerometer data.
I hope this will be helpful for future open-source projects involving the `XReal One/One Pro`, such as those involving support for `SteamVR` and `Android XR`.
